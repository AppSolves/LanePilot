# LanePilot ü§ñ

## Introduction üìñ
Welcome to **LanePilot**!

LanePilot is an advanced AI-based traffic management system designed to analyze real-time lane usage and congestion, enabling dynamic lane allocation and smarter traffic flow. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, LanePilot helps reduce bottlenecks, minimize CO‚ÇÇ emissions, improve road safety, and optimize urban mobility.

For more information, please view the [documentation](Documentation.pdf) (written in German).

## Features üöÄ
- [x] **Real-Time Lane Detection:** Uses AI and computer vision to detect lanes, vehicles, and congestion in real-time.
- [x] **Dynamic Lane Allocation:** Automatically suggests or controls lane assignments to optimize traffic flow.
- [x] **Modular Integration:** Easily integrates with existing traffic infrastructure and IoT devices.
- [x] **Data Logging & Visualization:** Stores and visualizes traffic data for analysis and reporting.

- **Not implemented yet**:
    - [ ] **Vehicle Classification:** Identifies vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks, buses) for tailored traffic management.
    - [ ] **Customizable Alerts:** Notifies operators or drivers about incidents, congestion, or recommended actions.
    - [ ] **Congestion Analysis:** Analyzes traffic patterns and congestion levels to provide insights for urban planners.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Binaries & Packages üì¶
If you prefer not to build from source, pre-built binaries and packages are available for various platforms. Check the [releases](https://github.com/AppSolves/LanePilot/releases) page for the latest versions or run the following commands to download the latest docker images:

- Raspberry Pi:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppSolves/LanePilot/refs/heads/main/scripts/compose.sh | bash -s raspberrypi
```

- NVIDIA Jetson:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppSolves/LanePilot/refs/heads/main/scripts/compose.sh | bash -s jetson
```

### Build from Source üî®

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AppSolves/LanePilot.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the root directory and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Additional Tools (if needed):**  
   - **Docker:** [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation instructions.
   - **CUDA, including cuDNN and TensorRT:** For GPU acceleration, install the appropriate CUDA version for your GPU. Follow the [NVIDIA installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) for your OS.

4. **Build Docker Images:**  
   If you wish to build manually, run the `scripts/build_opencv.sh` and `scripts/compose.sh` scripts:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh # Make all helper scripts executable
   ./scripts/build_opencv.sh # Build the OpenCV image (arm64 only)
   ./scripts/compose.sh [<platform>]
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Jetson image (more precisely, the `opencv_base` image) is built **without** the NVIDIA Video Codec SDK (`cudacodec` support).
> This is due to licensing issues with NVIDIA.
> If you need `cudacodec` support, please follow the instructions in the relevant [Dockerfile](opencv/Dockerfile.opencv) and build the image locally using the provided Dockerfile.

## Customization üé®

LanePilot is modular and configurable:
- **Detection Models:** Swap or retrain detection models in the `models/` directory.
- **Alerts & Actions:** Customize alert logic in the `common/` or `utils/` modules.
- **Configuration Files:** Edit the `config.yaml` files in submodules to adjust settings like model parameters, thresholds, and camera feeds.

## Usage üìù
Running LanePilot is as simple as running `docker compose` on your platform/device:

   ```bash
   scripts/compose.sh [<platform>] # Done ‚ú®
   ```
